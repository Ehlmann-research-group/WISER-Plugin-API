Tools-Menu Plugins
==================

Tool-menu plugins let you add an action to the Tool Menu (which is located in the top navigation bar). The tool menu plugin
will show up with the name you give it and when you click on it, the function you connect to the action trigger will be clicked on.

You may want to consider putting some of your actions in a sub menu if they are used less frequently.

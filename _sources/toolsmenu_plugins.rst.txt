Tool Menu Plugins
=================

Tool Menu plugins integrate into the toolbar in WISER. Specifically, all plugins
made in this way will be under the ``Tools`` tab. Tool menu plugins have access
to :class:`wiser.gui.app_state.ApplicationState` which gives a large amount of control over operations 
on datasets, spectra, and regions of interest (ROIs). The plugin you create must
subclass the :class:`wiser.plugins.ToolsMenuPlugin` type and fill in the various
operations that WISER would call. Specifically, fill in the ``add_tool_menu_items``
function.

Similar to context-menu Plugins, implementing a tool menu plugin requires
some familiarity with Qt 5, since the plugin must, at a minimum, add ``QMenu`` 
actions for specific operations that are exposed.  If a plugin intends to expose
its own GUI for configuration or other user interactions, please see 
:ref:`GUI Plugins in WISER` for more details on how this may be done. 
You will also need to understand everything in this section so that you can 
interface effectively with WISER's internals.

The ``ToolsMenuPlugin`` Class
-------------------------------

Tools menu plugins must derive the ``ToolsMenuPlugin`` class. The documentation 
for this class spells out the essential details for interfacing with WISER.
